OMDb and Dad Jokes Mashup
This project is a fun Python application that combines movie data from the OMDb API with dad jokes from the icanhazdadjoke API. For a given movie title, the app analyzes the plot, finds a keyword, and serves up relevant dad jokes using that keyword ‚Äî all with a bit of snark depending on the Rotten Tomatoes rating.

 Features
Fetches movie details from the OMDb API

Extracts Rotten Tomatoes ratings

Identifies the longest plot keyword with matching dad jokes

Pulls up to two relevant dad jokes using icanhazdadjoke.com

Outputs a humorous mashup that varies based on movie quality
